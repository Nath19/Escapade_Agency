# Escapade_Agency 🚙 🏠 🅿️ 👪



A stay is defined by a theme (on 3 characters) and a date. Each theme has a district of Paris and at each date (weekends only), a week number.
A stay includes the provision of a vehicle for two days (Saturday and Sunday) and accommodation in an RBNP accommodation organization with which Escapade has a global contract.
It uses, for this activity, its 40 cars (2-seater cabriolets or 4-seater sedans) that are rented on weekends only (Saturday and Sunday). These vehicles are luxury vehicles whose condition is followed very closely. A car is brand, model, registration and any other information that you think is useful or relevant.
Accommodation is chosen by the agency from the RBNP offers of the borough corresponding to the chosen theme.
For a stay, the agency is responsible for providing the customer with a car (for the two days of Saturday and Sunday) available on Saturday morning in the car park of the district concerned by the chosen theme and accommodation for the night from Saturday to Sunday. The car will be returned by the client on Sunday evening at the latest, in the car park of his choice among the car parks related to Escapade.
At the end of the weekend, the stay is noted by the customer: score from 0 to 5 and textual appreciation.
